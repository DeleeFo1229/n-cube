/**
 * A 'CommandCell' represents an executable cell. NCube ships
 * with support for Groovy CommandCells that allow the NCube author
 * to write cells that contain Groovy expressions, Groovy methods, or
 * Groovy classes.  Javascript executable cells, as well as Java
 * executable cells can be added to NCube.  The CommandCell expects
 * to call the method "Object run(Map args)" on whatever object is assigned
 * to the runnableCode member.
 *
 * Subclasses must implement 'getShortType()' which returns a fixed String
 * so that the NCube JSON reader can figure out what type of CommandCell to
 * instantiate when the CommandCell is specified in NCube's simpleJson format.
 *
 * Subclasses must also implement 'getCubeNamesFromCommandText()' which returns
 * any NCube names the subclass may reference.  For example, if NCubes are referenced
 * in the Groovy code, the Groovy CommandCell subclasses would return any NCube
 * names they reference.  This is required so that when an NCube is loaded,
 * it can find referenced NCubes and load those as well.
